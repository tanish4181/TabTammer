# YouTube Focus Mode

**YouTube Focus Mode** is a simple, lightweight **browser extension** designed to help you reclaim your focus on YouTube by removing distracting elements from the user interface.  

Tired of falling down the rabbit hole of recommended videos or getting drawn into comment section debates? YouTube Focus Mode cleans up your viewing experience, allowing you to watch what you came for without the digital noise.

## Installation

Since this extension is **not on the Chrome Web Store**, you need to load it manually:

1. **Download the Files:** Make sure you have all the extension files (`manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `content.js`, and the `images` folder) in a single folder on your computer.  
2. **Open Chrome Extensions:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your Google Chrome browser.  
3. **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, turn on the "Developer mode" switch.  
4. **Load the Extension:** Click the "Load unpacked" button.  
5. **Select the Folder:** Choose the folder where you saved the extension files.  

The **YouTube Focus Mode** extension icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar.
